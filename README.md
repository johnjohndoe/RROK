Random Rides Of Kindness
========================

The project is meant as a public relations campaign for [Ticketteilen.org][4]. Whenever somebody shared a ride for free it would be nice if this event leaves a track record. The map allows to store this information. Shared rides are visualized as a heat map overlay.
